# object_detection
Food detection using google object detection run on google colab


We will build a simple object detection tool to determine the Indian food on the image.

**Food classes/yypes considered:**
Idli 
Dosa

For this we will be using google's object detection API

**Data set for transfer learning:**

Used ssd_inception_v2_coco model, since it provides a relatively good trade-off between performance and speed, however there are a number of other models you can use, all of which are listed in below URL
